# SMSSpam
This was a semester project for a Pattern Matching master's class at Texas Tech University.

This repository includes an SMS spam repository originally from http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/, code that cleans the data up, RapidMiner data and processes used to classify the data, and my project report.

This is freely available to anyone who wishes to make use of it, with the usual provision that you cite your work. Note that the original SMS spam repository also requests you link to them if you use this corpus, and that you let them know you used it.
